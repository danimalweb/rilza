Being able to record MP3's to a minidisc player is an extremely useful bit of knowledge. This page will explain to you the various ways of doing it.<BR><BR>
First of all, Recording to portable MD recorder.<BR><BR>
You will need a 2.5mm jack to 2.5mm jack lead.
The input to a portable recorder is a 2.5mm jack socket. [See photo]<BR><BR>
This needs to be connected to the line out of your sound card. This is generally on the back of you pc. It's a small hole with the word lineout or a symbol next to it. Connect one end of your cable to this and one end to the line in of your MD player.<BR><BR>
Cue up your MP3s in your audio player [I recomend Winamp which is available from <A HREF="http://www.winamp.com">winamp.com</A>].<BR><BR>
It is best to try a test recording before recording a whole album, otherwise it takes alot of time to do the whole thing again. Press record on your MD player. Most minidisc players have an autovolume level for recording. This means that it will adjust the volume of what is being recorded so that if its quiet it will make it louder or vise-versa. Otherwise set the volume about 2/3 of the way up. Adjust the wave out volume and main output volume on your computer to just over half way up. Press play on the Minidisc player to start recording and press play on your mp3 player. You should now be able to listen to the headphones output of your MD player to test whether it is recording too loud of quiet. Adjust the recording volume of the main output as needed.<BR><BR>
Seconly, Recording to a minidisc hifi.<BR><BR>
Most hifi's have a double phono auxilary input. [See photo]<BR><BR>
Plug one end of your cable in to this and the other to the output of your computer as explained above. Set the Amplifier to Aux and press record on the MD recorder. Recording should now start. Press play on your MP3 player.<BR><BR>
Some portable minidisc players come with a USB connector. This changes the output of your computers sound to come out of the USB port rather than out of the soundcard output.<BR><BR>
